Classification of Javanese characters in mobile devices. In this project, it is a continuation of the learning project [cnn digit](https://github.com/Alstonargodi/CNN-digit-tkinter) before,but in this project the introduction of Javanese characters in handwritten form is entered by drawing on the canvas that has been provided, I also use this project as the final project for the pattern recognition course.

### ðŸŽ¯Point
In this project, I perform how to use Convolutional Neural Network for recognition pattern and using tensorflow lite. Starting from 
Making a model
 1. Retrieving the dataset I got from kaggle [Javanese letter](https://www.kaggle.com/phiard/aksara-jawa)
 2. Preprocessing dataset
 3. Showing the dataset for preview
 4. Making model and cnn architecture
 5. Training and validating
 6. Import a model as tensorflow lite

### ðŸ“¦ Others
