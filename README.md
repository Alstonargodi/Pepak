Classification of Javanese characters in mobile devices. In this project, it is a continuation of the learning project [cnn digit](https://github.com/Alstonargodi/CNN-digit-tkinter) before,but in this project the introduction of Javanese characters in handwritten form is entered by drawing on the canvas that has been provided, I also use this project as the final project for the pattern recognition course.

### ðŸŽ¯Point
In this project, I perform how to use Convolutional Neural networks for pattern recognition and using TensorFlow lite. Starting from Preprocessing the dataset, making the TensorFlow lite model and building the android apps

### ðŸ“¦ Others 
- Aksara jawa  dataset
Before making a model we need a dataset first and I use that from Kaggle  [Aksara jawa dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/phiard/aksara-jawa)

 - [Tensorflow lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite)
An open source deep learning framework for on-device inference

 - [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/)
Glide is a fast and efficient image loading library for Android 

- [Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database)
a cloud-hosted database provide by google for saving  dataset of Javanese script words and reduce the size of the application itself
